# The command to run, usually a shell. If this is not an absolute path, it'll
# be looked up in the `PATH`. If this is not set, a default will be looked up
# from your system. The rules for the default lookup are:
#
#   * `SHELL` environment variable
#
#   * `passwd` entry (user information)
#
# This can contain additional arguments to run the command with. If additional
# arguments are provided, the command will be executed using `/bin/sh -c`
# to offload shell argument expansion.
#
# To avoid shell expansion altogether, prefix the command with `direct:`, e.g.
# `direct:nvim foo`. This will avoid the roundtrip to `/bin/sh` but will also
# not support any shell parsing such as arguments with spaces, filepaths with
# `~`, globs, etc. (Available since: 1.2.0)
#
# You can also explicitly prefix the command with `shell:` to always wrap the
# command in a shell. This can be used to ensure our heuristics to choose the
# right mode are not used in case they are wrong. (Available since: 1.2.0)
#
# This command will be used for all new terminal surfaces, i.e. new windows,
# tabs, etc. If you want to run a command only for the first terminal surface
# created when Ghostty starts, use the `initial-command` configuration.
#
# Ghostty supports the common `-e` flag for executing a command with
# arguments. For example, `ghostty -e fish --with --custom --args`.
# This flag sets the `initial-command` configuration, see that for more
# information.

# macOS doesn't have a distinct "alt" key and instead has the "option"
# key which behaves slightly differently. On macOS by default, the
# option key plus a character will sometimes produce a Unicode character.
# For example, on US standard layouts option-b produces "âˆ«". This may be
# undesirable if you want to use "option" as an "alt" key for keybindings
# in terminal programs or shells.
#
# This configuration lets you change the behavior so that option is treated
# as alt.
#
# The default behavior (unset) will depend on your active keyboard
# layout. If your keyboard layout is one of the keyboard layouts listed
# below, then the default value is "true". Otherwise, the default
# value is "false". Keyboard layouts with a default value of "true" are:
#
#   - U.S. Standard
#   - U.S. International
#
# Note that if an *Option*-sequence doesn't produce a printable character, it
# will be treated as *Alt* regardless of this setting. (e.g. `alt+ctrl+a`).
#
# Explicit values that can be set:
#
# If `true`, the *Option* key will be treated as *Alt*. This makes terminal
# sequences expecting *Alt* to work properly, but will break Unicode input
# sequences on macOS if you use them via the *Alt* key.
#
# You may set this to `false` to restore the macOS *Alt* key unicode
# sequences but this will break terminal sequences expecting *Alt* to work.
#
# The values `left` or `right` enable this for the left or right *Option*
# key, respectively.
