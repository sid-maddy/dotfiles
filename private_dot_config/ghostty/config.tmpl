# The font families to use.
#
# You can generate the list of valid values using the CLI:
#
#     ghostty +list-fonts
#
# This configuration can be repeated multiple times to specify preferred
# fallback fonts when the requested codepoint is not available in the primary
# font. This is particularly useful for multiple languages, symbolic fonts,
# etc.
#
# Notes on emoji specifically: On macOS, Ghostty by default will always use
# Apple Color Emoji and on Linux will always use Noto Emoji. You can
# override this behavior by specifying a font family here that contains
# emoji glyphs.
#
# The specific styles (bold, italic, bold italic) do not need to be
# explicitly set. If a style is not set, then the regular style (font-family)
# will be searched for stylistic variants. If a stylistic variant is not
# found, Ghostty will use the regular style. This prevents falling back to a
# different font family just to get a style such as bold. This also applies
# if you explicitly specify a font family for a style. For example, if you
# set `font-family-bold = FooBar` and "FooBar" cannot be found, Ghostty will
# use whatever font is set for `font-family` for the bold style.
#
# Finally, some styles may be synthesized if they are not supported.
# For example, if a font does not have an italic style and no alternative
# italic font is specified, Ghostty will synthesize an italic style by
# applying a slant to the regular style. If you want to disable these
# synthesized styles then you can use the `font-style` configurations
# as documented below.
#
# You can disable styles completely by using the `font-style` set of
# configurations. See the documentation for `font-style` for more information.
#
# If you want to overwrite a previous set value rather than append a fallback,
# specify the value as `""` (empty string) to reset the list and then set the
# new values. For example:
#
#     font-family = ""
#     font-family = "My Favorite Font"
#
# Setting any of these as CLI arguments will automatically clear the
# values set in configuration files so you don't need to specify
# `--font-family=""` before setting a new value. You only need to specify
# this within config files if you want to clear previously set values in
# configuration files or on the CLI if you want to clear values set on the
# CLI.
#
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals, i.e.
# new windows, tabs, etc.
font-family = VictorMono Nerd Font

# Font size in points. This value can be a non-integer and the nearest integer
# pixel size will be selected. If you have a high dpi display where 1pt = 2px
# then you can get an odd numbered pixel size by specifying a half point.
#
# For example, 13.5pt @ 2px/pt = 27px
#
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals,
# i.e. new windows, tabs, etc. Note that you may still not see the change
# depending on your `window-inherit-font-size` setting. If that setting is
# true, only the first window will be affected by this change since all
# subsequent windows will inherit the font size of the previous window.

# A theme to use. This can be a built-in theme name, a custom theme
# name, or an absolute path to a custom theme file. Ghostty also supports
# specifying a different theme to use for light and dark mode. Each
# option is documented below.
#
# If the theme is an absolute pathname, Ghostty will attempt to load that
# file as a theme. If that file does not exist or is inaccessible, an error
# will be logged and no other directories will be searched.
#
# If the theme is not an absolute pathname, two different directories will be
# searched for a file name that matches the theme. This is case sensitive on
# systems with case-sensitive filesystems. It is an error for a theme name to
# include path separators unless it is an absolute pathname.
#
# The first directory is the `themes` subdirectory of your Ghostty
# configuration directory. This is `$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/ghostty/themes` or
# `~/.config/ghostty/themes`.
#
# The second directory is the `themes` subdirectory of the Ghostty resources
# directory. Ghostty ships with a multitude of themes that will be installed
# into this directory. On macOS, this list is in the `Ghostty.app/Contents/
# Resources/ghostty/themes` directory. On Linux, this list is in the `share/
# ghostty/themes` directory (wherever you installed the Ghostty "share"
# directory.
#
# To see a list of available themes, run `ghostty +list-themes`.
#
# A theme file is simply another Ghostty configuration file. They share
# the same syntax and same configuration options. A theme can set any valid
# configuration option so please do not use a theme file from an untrusted
# source. The built-in themes are audited to only set safe configuration
# options.
#
# Some options cannot be set within theme files. The reason these are not
# supported should be self-evident. A theme file cannot set `theme` or
# `config-file`. At the time of writing this, Ghostty will not show any
# warnings or errors if you set these options in a theme file but they will
# be silently ignored.
#
# Any additional colors specified via background, foreground, palette, etc.
# will override the colors specified in the theme.
#
# To specify a different theme for light and dark mode, use the following
# syntax: `light:theme-name,dark:theme-name`. For example:
# `light:rose-pine-dawn,dark:rose-pine`. Whitespace around all values are
# trimmed and order of light and dark does not matter. Both light and dark
# must be specified in this form. In this form, the theme used will be
# based on the current desktop environment theme.
#
# There are some known bugs with light/dark mode theming. These will
# be fixed in a future update:
#
#   - macOS: titlebar tabs style is not updated when switching themes.

# The minimum contrast ratio between the foreground and background colors.
# The contrast ratio is a value between 1 and 21. A value of 1 allows for no
# contrast (i.e. black on black). This value is the contrast ratio as defined
# by the [WCAG 2.0 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).
#
# If you want to avoid invisible text (same color as background), a value of
# 1.1 is a good value. If you want to avoid text that is difficult to read, a
# value of 3 or higher is a good value. The higher the value, the more likely
# that text will become black or white.
#
# This value does not apply to Emoji or images.

# Hide the mouse immediately when typing. The mouse becomes visible again
# when the mouse is used (button, movement, etc.). Platform-specific behavior

# The opacity level (opposite of transparency) of the background. A value of
# 1 is fully opaque and a value of 0 is fully transparent. A value less than 0
# or greater than 1 will be clamped to the nearest valid value.
#
# On macOS, background opacity is disabled when the terminal enters native
# fullscreen. This is because the background becomes gray and it can cause
# widgets to show through which isn't generally desirable.
background-opacity = 0.8

# A positive value enables blurring of the background when background-opacity
# is less than 1. The value is the blur radius to apply. A value of 20
# is reasonable for a good looking blur. Higher values will cause strange
# rendering issues as well as performance issues.
#
# This is only supported on macOS.

# The command to run, usually a shell. If this is not an absolute path, it'll
# be looked up in the `PATH`. If this is not set, a default will be looked up
# from your system. The rules for the default lookup are:
#
#   * `SHELL` environment variable
#
#   * `passwd` entry (user information)
#
# This can contain additional arguments to run the command with. If additional
# arguments are provided, the command will be executed using `/bin/sh -c`.
# Ghostty does not do any shell command parsing.
#
# This command will be used for all new terminal surfaces, i.e. new windows,
# tabs, etc. If you want to run a command only for the first terminal surface
# created when Ghostty starts, use the `initial-command` configuration.
#
# Ghostty supports the common `-e` flag for executing a command with
# arguments. For example, `ghostty -e fish --with --custom --args`.
# This flag sets the `initial-command` configuration, see that for more
# information.

# The size of the scrollback buffer in bytes. This also includes the active

# scrollback.
#
# Scrollback currently exists completely in memory. This means that the
# larger this value, the larger potential memory usage. Scrollback is
# allocated lazily up to this limit, so if you set this to a very large
# value, it will not immediately consume a lot of memory.
#
# This size is per terminal surface, not for the entire application.
#
# It is not currently possible to set an unlimited scrollback buffer.
# This is a future planned feature.
#
# This can be changed at runtime but will only affect new terminal surfaces.

# Key bindings. The format is `trigger=action`. Duplicate triggers will
# overwrite previously set values. The list of actions is available in
# the documentation or using the `ghostty +list-actions` command.
#
# Trigger: `+`-separated list of keys and modifiers. Example: `ctrl+a`,
# `ctrl+shift+b`, `up`. Some notes:
#
#   * modifiers cannot repeat, `ctrl+ctrl+a` is invalid.
#
#   * modifiers and keys can be in any order, `shift+a+ctrl` is *weird*,
#     but valid.
#
#   * only a single key input is allowed, `ctrl+a+b` is invalid.
#
#   * the key input can be prefixed with `physical:` to specify a
#     physical key mapping rather than a logical one. A physical key
#     mapping responds to the hardware keycode and not the keycode
#     translated by any system keyboard layouts. Example: "ctrl+physical:a"
#
# Valid modifiers are `shift`, `ctrl` (alias: `control`), `alt` (alias: `opt`,
# `option`), and `super` (alias: `cmd`, `command`). You may use the modifier
# or the alias. When debugging keybinds, the non-aliased modifier will always
# be used in output.
#
# Note: The fn or "globe" key on keyboards are not supported as a
# modifier. This is a limitation of the operating systems and GUI toolkits
# that Ghostty uses.
#
# You may also specify multiple triggers separated by `>` to require a
# sequence of triggers to activate the action. For example,
# `ctrl+a>n=new_window` will only trigger the `new_window` action if the
# user presses `ctrl+a` followed separately by `n`. In other software, this
# is sometimes called a leader key, a key chord, a key table, etc. There
# is no hardcoded limit on the number of parts in a sequence.
#
# Warning: If you define a sequence as a CLI argument to `ghostty`,
# you probably have to quote the keybind since `>` is a special character
# in most shells. Example: ghostty --keybind='ctrl+a>n=new_window'
#
# A trigger sequence has some special handling:
#
#   * Ghostty will wait an indefinite amount of time for the next key in
#     the sequence. There is no way to specify a timeout. The only way to
#     force the output of a prefix key is to assign another keybind to
#     specifically output that key (i.e. `ctrl+a>ctrl+a=text:foo`) or
#     press an unbound key which will send both keys to the program.
#
#   * If a prefix in a sequence is previously bound, the sequence will
#     override the previous binding. For example, if `ctrl+a` is bound to
#     `new_window` and `ctrl+a>n` is bound to `new_tab`, pressing `ctrl+a`
#     will do nothing.
#
#   * Adding to the above, if a previously bound sequence prefix is
#     used in a new, non-sequence binding, the entire previously bound
#     sequence will be unbound. For example, if you bind `ctrl+a>n` and
#     `ctrl+a>t`, and then bind `ctrl+a` directly, both `ctrl+a>n` and
#     `ctrl+a>t` will become unbound.
#
#   * Trigger sequences are not allowed for `global:` or `all:`-prefixed
#     triggers. This is a limitation we could remove in the future.
#
# Action is the action to take when the trigger is satisfied. It takes the
# format `action` or `action:param`. The latter form is only valid if the
# action requires a parameter.
#
#   * `ignore` - Do nothing, ignore the key input. This can be used to
#     black hole certain inputs to have no effect.
#
#   * `unbind` - Remove the binding. This makes it so the previous action
#     is removed, and the key will be sent through to the child command
#     if it is printable.
#
#   * `csi:text` - Send a CSI sequence. i.e. `csi:A` sends "cursor up".
#
#   * `esc:text` - Send an escape sequence. i.e. `esc:d` deletes to the
#     end of the word to the right.
#
#   * `text:text` - Send a string. Uses Zig string literal syntax.
#     i.e. `text:\x15` sends Ctrl-U.
#
#   * All other actions can be found in the documentation or by using the
#     `ghostty +list-actions` command.
#
# Some notes for the action:
#
#   * The parameter is taken as-is after the `:`. Double quotes or
#     other mechanisms are included and NOT parsed. If you want to
#     send a string value that includes spaces, wrap the entire
#     trigger/action in double quotes. Example: `--keybind="up=csi:A B"`
#
# There are some additional special values that can be specified for
# keybind:
#
#   * `keybind=clear` will clear all set keybindings. Warning: this
#     removes ALL keybindings up to this point, including the default
#     keybindings.
#
# The keybind trigger can be prefixed with some special values to change
# the behavior of the keybind. These are:
#
#   * `all:` - Make the keybind apply to all terminal surfaces. By default,
#     keybinds only apply to the focused terminal surface. If this is true,
#     then the keybind will be sent to all terminal surfaces. This only
#     applies to actions that are surface-specific. For actions that
#     are already global (i.e. `quit`), this prefix has no effect.
#
#   * `global:` - Make the keybind global. By default, keybinds only work
#     within Ghostty and under the right conditions (application focused,
#     sometimes terminal focused, etc.). If you want a keybind to work
#     globally across your system (i.e. even when Ghostty is not focused),
#     specify this prefix. This prefix implies `all:`. Note: this does not
#     work in all environments; see the additional notes below for more
#     information.
#
#   * `unconsumed:` - Do not consume the input. By default, a keybind
#     will consume the input, meaning that the associated encoding (if
#     any) will not be sent to the running program in the terminal. If
#     you wish to send the encoded value to the program, specify the
#     `unconsumed:` prefix before the entire keybind. For example:
#     `unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config`. `global:` and `all:`-prefixed
#     keybinds will always consume the input regardless of this setting.
#     Since they are not associated with a specific terminal surface,
#     they're never encoded.
#
# Keybind triggers are not unique per prefix combination. For example,
# `ctrl+a` and `global:ctrl+a` are not two separate keybinds. The keybind
# set later will overwrite the keybind set earlier. In this case, the
# `global:` keybind will be used.
#
# Multiple prefixes can be specified. For example,
# `global:unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config` will make the keybind global
# and not consume the input to reload the config.
#
# Note: `global:` is only supported on macOS. On macOS,
# this feature requires accessibility permissions to be granted to Ghostty.
# When a `global:` keybind is specified and Ghostty is launched or reloaded,
# Ghostty will attempt to request these permissions. If the permissions are
# not granted, the keybind will not work. On macOS, you can find these
# permissions in System Preferences -> Privacy & Security -> Accessibility.

# The initial window size. This size is in terminal grid cells by default.
# Both values must be set to take effect. If only one value is set, it is
# ignored.
#
# We don't currently support specifying a size in pixels but a future change
# can enable that. If this isn't specified, the app runtime will determine
# some default size.
#
# Note that the window manager may put limits on the size or override the
# size. For example, a tiling window manager may force the window to be a
# certain size to fit within the grid. There is nothing Ghostty will do about
# this, but it will make an effort.
#
# Sizes larger than the screen size will be clamped to the screen size.
# This can be used to create a maximized-by-default window size.
#
# This will not affect new tabs, splits, or other nested terminal elements.
# This only affects the initial window size of any new window. Changing this
# value will not affect the size of the window after it has been created. This
# is only used for the initial size.
#
# BUG: On Linux with GTK, the calculated window size will not properly take
# into account window decorations. As a result, the grid dimensions will not
# exactly match this configuration. If window decorations are disabled (see

# Control the auto-update functionality of Ghostty. This is only supported

# managers that are not centrally controlled by Ghostty.
#
# Checking or downloading an update does not send any information to

# underlying protocols. To put it another way: Ghostty doesn't explicitly
# add any tracking to the update process. The update process works by
# downloading information about the latest version and comparing it
# client-side to the current version.
#
# Valid values are:
#
#  * `off` - Disable auto-updates.
#  * `check` - Check for updates and notify the user if an update is
#    available, but do not automatically download or install the update.
#  * `download` - Check for updates, automatically download the update,
#    notify the user, but do not automatically install the update.
#
# The default value is `check`.
#
# Changing this value at runtime works after a small delay.

# Additional configuration files to read. This configuration can be repeated
# to read multiple configuration files. Configuration files themselves can
# load more configuration files. Paths are relative to the file containing the

#
# Prepend a ? character to the file path to suppress errors if the file does

# the configuration file will be ignored.
#
# Configuration files are loaded after the configuration they're defined
# within in the order they're defined. **THIS IS A VERY SUBTLE BUT IMPORTANT
# POINT.** To put it another way: configuration files do not take effect
# until after the entire configuration is loaded. For example, in the
# configuration below:
#
# ```
# config-file = "foo"
# a = 1
# ```
#
# If "foo" contains `a = 2`, the final value of `a` will be 2, because
# `foo` is loaded after the configuration file that configures the
# nested `config-file` value.
